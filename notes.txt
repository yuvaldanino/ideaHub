What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You pay only for the compute time you consume, and there is a free tier available.

What Will We Use Lambda For?
We'll use AWS Lambda to handle backend logic, such as:

Processing requests from the frontend.
Calling the GPT-4 model deployed on SageMaker.
Interacting with the database (RDS).
Uploading and retrieving files from S3.

Exactly! You've got it. By using AWS Lambda to handle the API calls to 
your SageMaker model, you can efficiently manage the backend logic 
without needing a constantly running server. This setup is both 
cost-effective and scalable.


**using .YAML to create EC2 instance 
- AWS CloudGromation 
-   CloudFormation will create the resources defined 
    in your template, including the EC2 instance and security group.

    Summary of the Flow
User Interaction:

A user interacts with your application hosted on the EC2 instance (e.g., using the Gradio UI).
API Request:

The EC2 instance sends an API request to the API Gateway Invoke URL.
API Gateway:

API Gateway receives the request and routes it to the appropriate Lambda function.
Lambda Execution:

The Lambda function processes the request, calls the SageMaker endpoint, and retrieves the model's output.
Response Handling:

The Lambda function processes the response from SageMaker and sends it back to the EC2 instance via API Gateway.
The EC2 instance then displays the result to the user


Flow Diagram
User → EC2 Instance:

The user interacts with the application hosted on the EC2 instance.
EC2 Instance → API Gateway:

The EC2 instance sends an API request to the API Gateway.
API Gateway → Lambda Function:

API Gateway routes the request to the Lambda function.
Lambda Function → SageMaker Endpoint:

The Lambda function calls the SageMaker endpoint with the input text.
SageMaker Endpoint → Lambda Function:

The SageMaker endpoint processes the input and returns the generated outline to the Lambda function.
Lambda Function → DynamoDB:

The Lambda function stores the generated outline in DynamoDB.
Lambda Function → API Gateway:

The Lambda function sends the response back to the API Gateway.
API Gateway → EC2 Instance:

API Gateway forwards the response to the EC2 instance.
EC2 Instance → User:

The EC2 instance displays the result to the user.
