Project Recap
Idea Hub Concept:

Convert spoken ideas into structured outlines using advanced AI models and AWS services.
Technologies Used:

Whisper: For speech-to-text conversion.
GPT-4: For generating outlines from transcribed text.
Gradio: For the frontend and user interface.
AWS Services: Lambda, SageMaker, S3, DynamoDB, SNS, API Gateway, EventBridge, and CloudWatch.
Workflow:

User Interaction: User records their idea using the Gradio interface on an EC2 instance.
Audio Processing: Audio file is uploaded to S3 and converted to text using Whisper.
Outline Generation: Text is sent to GPT-4 via a Lambda function, and the generated outline is stored in DynamoDB.
Notification: EventBridge triggers an SNS notification to the user once the outline is stored.
Monitoring: CloudWatch monitors the entire process.
Code and Configuration
Lambda Function: Handles backend logic, including calling the SageMaker endpoint, uploading files to S3, storing data in DynamoDB, and sending notifications via SNS.
CloudFormation Templates: Define the infrastructure setup for EC2, S3, SNS, EventBridge, and other AWS services.
